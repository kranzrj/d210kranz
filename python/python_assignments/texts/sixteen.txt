sunlight shines down through a skylight above the brass
bed. The sheets and blankets are rumpled and kicked aside.
<char who="sam">Samantha Baker</char> stands before a floor mirror in the corner
of the room. Her back is to camera. A bath towel is
wrapped around her waist. She's staring at her body in the
mirror. She was up long before anyone else in the house
and has already showered. She puts a hand on her hip and
strikes a pose. She doesn't like it. She tries the other
hand. Both hands. She cocks her hip. Finally, she raises
both arms and strikes a Charles Atlas pose. She holds it
for a moment, then drops her arms. She groans.

her arm to tap his shoulder. The music stops. He turns
around with Caroline's blazer and is as shocked to see
Sam as she is to see him. He quickly adjusts to the
situation and puts on his best and sexiest smile. Sam's
courage evaporates, she panics and rather than faint,
throw up or say something incredibly stupid, she keeps on

anger and embarrassment.
SAM
I'm totally retarded! He smiles and
I spaz. I'm blitzed! I don't
deserve him.

INT. GYM - JAKE
He helps Caroline on with her blazer. He's still cursing
himself. He looks down the bleachers to try and catch a
glimpse of Sam.
CAROLINE
Are you blushing?
JAKE
Hell, no. Why would I do that?
CAROLINE
I don't know. You tell me.
JAKE
Maybe I just need some party action.
Caroline smiles with relief.
CAROLINE
Oh, thank God. You're normal again.
Caroline walks on ahead. Jake rolls his eyes and hangs
back for one last look at the gym.
JAKE
(sighs)
I want that girl ....
INT. GYM - BLEACHERS
Sam peeks around the bleachers and sees Jake and Caroline
leaving.
SAM
I'm such a faggot. Such a complete
weasel.
She rests her chin on the bleachers and closes her eyes.
SAM
And I can't believe I gave my panties
to a geek.
INT. HALLWAY - BOY'S BATHROOM DOOR
A Freshman sneaks up to the door and knocks softly. The
door opens and Cliff looks out.
CLIFF
What year are you?
FRESHMAN
Freshman.

CLIFF
Gimme a buck.
The Freshman hands Cliff a five. Cliff takes a fat wad of
singles from his pocket and counts out four in change.
INT. BATHROOM
The bathroom is jammed with shrimpy freshman boys. They're
all talking excitedly. Bryce flashes the lights.
BRYCE
Okay, everybody, shut up!
The room quiets down.
CLIFF
Ted? Go for it, man.
A stall door slowly opens and the Geek steps out. Heraldic
music comes up. With great drama and showmanship, the Geek
holds up Sam's tiny, baby blue Garfield the cat panties.
The freshmen gasp in awe and drop to their knees.
INT. GYM - SAM
She's putting on her coat. She's had enough. Randy's
hanging on Jimmy. She feels for Sam and is trying to
convince her to stay.
RANDY
Where are you gonna go?
SAM
I'll wait in the car until Duck Dork
gets danced out.
RANDY
Don't do that. Stay here with us.
SAM
No. I gotta get outta here before
anything else terrible happens ..
RANDY
No offense, but what more could happen?
INT. SCHOOL - DARK HALLWAY
It's dark and spooky. We hear the chilling, ominous
opening bars of the Jaws Theme. A beat and Grandpa Fred
peeks around the corner. Then Dorothy, Howard and Helen.
The grandparents are invading the dance!

INT. OLDSMOBILE
Dong's driving, Sam's in the passenger seat and the
Lumberjack's in the middle, tucked up tight against her new-
found Korean beau. Dong has his arm around her and is
driving with one finger. Sam's depressed and embarrassed.
The Lumberjack turns to Sam and chucks her on the arm.
LUMBERJACK
I think I played intermural B-ball
with you last year. You were the
one who dribbles like a girl.
SAM
(forces a smile)
That's me.
The Lumberjack nods.
LUMBERJACK
Hey, listen, thanks for loaning me
the Donger. He's bitchin'.
SAM
It's okay, you guys make a great couple.
The Lumberjack looks at Dong. They exchange loving looks.
DONG
I never been so more happy in my
entire whole life.
LUMBERJACK
(embarrassed)
You maniac!
DON
I have now a place to put my hands!
Sam rolls her eyes and slumps further down in the seat.
The Lunberjack lets out an earthy yelp, as Dong gooses her.
EXT. DRIVE-IN - NIGHT
The Oldsmobile screams into the drive-in at fifty-five mph,
loc~s up the brakes and skids into a tight spot between two
other cars, miraculously avoiding them both. Dong throws
open his door, banging the car next to him. He yanks the
Lumberjack out and they head for the restaurant. Parked
outside is a motorcycle. Dong and Lumberjack admire it.
LUMBERJACK
Kawasaki.
DONG
You're welcome.
64
EXT. CAR
Jimmy Montrose's car pulls in behind the Olds. Randy gets
out and hurries to Sam's window. Sam looks up. Randy leans
in the window. She's upset.
RANDY
Sam? Are you sitting down?
Sam looks over at her. Of course she's sitting down.
RANDY
I don't want to depress you.
Sam covers her head and slumps down in the seat.
SAM
What now?
INT. DRIVE-IN RESTAURANT BATHROOM - LATER
Sam's mouth is wide open. She's stunned. Randy feels
terrible about having to be the bearer of bad news.
RANDY
Be thankful you got out of there
before your grandparents showed up.
SAM
(stunned
monotone)
Oh, my God.
RANDY
It was pretty weird. They told every-
body baby stories about you.
SAM
Oh, my God.
RANDY
Your grandfather who always makes
the shitty jokes hijacked the mike
and sang some really bizarre songs.
SAM
Oh, my God.
RANDY
The good news is, they pretty much
trashed the dance. Everybody kind
of took off like right away.

Randy puts a consoling arm around Sam. She can't think of
anything encouraging to say.
SAM
I'm infected.
RANDY
Just forget about it, okay? Come with
me and Jimmy. There's a monster party
over at Jake Ryan's.
Sam looks at Randy like she's crazy.
SAM
I'm sure I'd go over there. For
what? Hyperhumiliation?
RANDY
You gotta stop torturing yourself.
SAM
I'm not doing anything to me!
RANDY
I mean about Jake. What you should
do is go with us, okay? Maybe
Jake'll get shitfaced and act dis-
gusting and you'll lose interest in
him. Remember last summer how bad I
had a crush on that guy from Maine?
I had a hard-on every waking minute
until he puked on my feet. For the
rest of the summer, everytime I saw
him I gagged.
SAM
I think Jake could puke anywhere on
me and it wouldn't bother me.
RANDY
I don't know, Sam. It's pretty
valid. I thought I'd die for this
guy but when it came right down to
it, my feet were more important.
Sam shakes her head no.
SAM
No, thanks.
(sniffles)
I can't believe I have to go to a
wedding tomorrow. You know how many
times I'm going to have to smile?
I'll probably get a facial hernia.

The bathroom door slams open and the Lumberjack clomps in.
LUMBERJACK
Hi, dudes.
Randy and Sam wave. Lumberjack goes into a stall. Sam
jumps down off the sink. Randy gives her a hug.
RANDY
If you want some company, I'll tell
Jimmy I just got my period.
SAM
It's okay. I'm fine.
Randy kisses her cheek. She starts to leave. From the
stall we hear the Lumberjack going. It sounds like a
horse. Randy and Sam exchange puzzled glances. They bend
over and look under the stall.
THEIR POINT OF VIEW - THE LUMBERJACK'S HIGHTOPS
are in front of the toilet, pointing in. She's going
standing up.
EXT. DRIVE-IN
Dong is still looking at the bike. He climbs on it. Pre-
tends to drive it. As he dismounts, he kicks the engine
over. The bike flies into the parking lot.
EXT. DRIVE-IN - DOOR
The meanest-looking biker in the world comes out with his
old lady on his arm. He sees his bike in a heap in the
parking lot.
INT. COUNTRY CLUB DINING ROOM - SAME TIME
It's very stately and sedate. Jim and Brenda, Ginny and
her fiance, Rudy and his parents, Bruno and Irene have
finished dinner and are enjoying after-dinner drinks. Bruno
looks like a retired prize fighter. He's wearing a black
polyester leisure suit with white stitching, an egg yellow
silk shirt, a gold nugget on a chain and a massive diamond
pinkie ring. Irene's wearing a dress fit for a madame.
Her bleached pink/blonde hair is styled in a fashion that
would shame a country singer. They are a bellowing
contrast to the blue blazers and monogram blouses of the
members. Between puffs on his Havana, Bruno explains to a
nervous and worried Jim, what business he's in.

BRUNO
Basically, Jimmy, my business is
video game arcades, laundry,
cigarette machines and trucking.
I dabble a little in personal
loans and politics.
JIM

Well, all that matters is that the
kids are happy together.
IRENE
Just so long as my beautiful boy
remembers that marrying this one ...

thumb to
Ginny)

the-Month-Club.'
She chuckles.
RUDY
I can still look, I just can't touch.

Right?
She forces a smile.
EXT. JAKE'S HOUSE
A million dollars of contemporary field stone and glass on a
wooded. acre. Cars are jammed up in the driveway, on the
lawn, in the woods. Elegant streams of toilet paper hang
from the trees. Every light in the house is on. Windows
are open, music is blasting.
INT. KITCHEN
A magnificent cook's kitchen. A thoroughly raped refrigerator/
freezer is empty and open. There are bottles and cans covering
every inch of available space. Drunk kids are weaving in and
out, kissing, shouting, fighting. One bemused youth is trying
to put out a fire in the oven. He pops a beer can, drinks some,
pours some on the fire, drinks the rest. Pops another.
Caroline staggers in.

KID
Who's Jake?
CAROLINE

INT. LIVING ROOM
Jake's parent's vacation videos are playing on the giant
screen. Kids are howling at the home movies. The room's a
disaster. People are piled on the furniture, pizza boxes
are overturned on silk Orientals. Two boys are dancing
with each other. A drunken hulk is eating a raw slab of
sirloin. A drunk sick kid is sitting on a chair with a
Ming vase between his knees. Caroline weaves in.
CAROLINE
You people are huge pigs! Look at
what you've done to Jake's house!
She steps up on a coffee table and looks around for Jake.
CAROLINE
Jakey!
INT. INDOOR POOL AREA
All the pool furniture is in the pool along with a bunch of
rude, wild kids, clothed, semiclothed and nude. They're
beating the water as one of them stands on the side,
pouring liquid dish detergent in the water to make a huge
bubble bath of the pool. Caroline stumbles in.
CAROLINE
Jake!
(sees the
bubbles)
Outrageous! I love bubble baths!
INT. BEDROOM WING
A drunk Girl in panties and bra is talking to a drunk guy.

Caroline wanders past yelling for Jake.

Jake's mother's furs. They grab Caroline.
TRACY
These coats are so excellent! Can we
have 'em?
ROBIN
I'll be your best friend forever,

I think Jake's mom might freak out
if you ripped off her coats.
TRACY
She won't mind, I swear to God.
CAROLINE
Are you sure?
TRACY
Cross my heart.
CAROLINE
Okay. But you gotta tell me where
Jake is.
Tracy and Robin points feebly down the hall.
CAROLINE
Tell me truthfully. Is he with somebody?
CLOSEUP - SAMANTHA'S YEARBOOK PICTURE
A typical sweet-smile pose. A boy's finger traces down the

He hangs up and writes the number down. He picks up the
phone and dials. He unconsciously fixes his hair. He
clears his throat.

Sam's phone rings in the darkened bedroom. It rings and

unamused.
CAROLINE
I fell!
JAKE
It's that tunny, huh?
CAROLINE
How come the door was locked?

Caroline sits up on her elbows and nods.
JAKE
Good. Is the house demolished?
Caroline looks at him for a moment, fighting off a smile.
Finally she snorts and lets out a horse laugh. Jake jumps
up and tears out of the room.
CAROLINE
He's grounded for the next twenty-
five thousand years.
She collapses with laughter.
EXT. SAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT
The Oldsmobile races up, locks brakes and skids into the curb.
The passenger door opens and Sam gets out. The Olds squeals
away. Sam watches it disappear into the night.
SAM
The Donger's in town five hours and
he's got somebody. I live here all
my life and I'm like a disease.
EXT. HOUSE - FRONT DOOR
Sam reaches into the mailbox for the house key. As she
opens the door it occurs to her, that the family may be
planning to surprise her.
She opens the door quietly and slips in.
INT. FOYER
Sam closes the door softly. She's smiling, thinking she
has it all figured out. She takes off her jacket and
tiptoes into the living room.
INT. LIVING ROOM
Sam looks around the dark room. She turns on a light and
braces herself for the big surprise. Nothing. Sitting
on the couch is a neat stack of bedding -- sheets, blanket
and pillow. Another unconscious, unintentional jab at Sam's
lonely heart. Everyone in the house is asleep.

Jake stands in the midst of the riot going on in his parent's
house. He's resigned to it and the consequences he knows
he'll have to face. Caroline comes up into frame, crawling
up his body as he stands stiff and tall. She snakes her
arms around his neck.
CAROLINE
You're the only one at the party
who isn't having a party. Don't you
like to party anymore?
He looks at her passively.
He plants his hand squarely on her face and gives her a
gentle shove. She keels over and crashes to the floor.

She's apparently oblivious to his dangerous look.
MEGAN
So, what school do you go to?
The biker looks at her through half-closed lids.
MEGAN

If I had to guess I'd say St. Anthony's

The biker holds his incredulous stare and curls an angry
lip revealing a horrifying mouthful of decayed teeth.
MEGAN

I don't mean to be obnoxious but
you really should consider an
orthodonist. My orthodonist is
the best. He's amazingly gorgeous
and he doesn't have hairy hands. It
is so gross to have disgusting
hairy men's hands in your mouth,
and ....
The biker puts his cigarette out in his mouth, momentarily
silencing the girl.
MEGAN
Didn't that hurt?
We move off the biker to his old lady sitting next to him.
She's drinking a bottle of beer. There's a jock sitting
next to her. He's checking her out. She looks at him. He
raises a seductive eyebrow. She pushes the bottle into her
mouth and twists it slowly back and forth in an even more
seductive gesture. The jock's eyes light up. He smiles.
The biker's old lady leans forward. The jock leans forward
to meet her. The biker's old lady bites the end off the
bottle and chews the glass. The jock's face register's
total fear. He backs away.

The Geek puts the beer to his lips. He closes his eyes and
throws the can back. He holds the can back, but doesn't

an even more trashed house.
INT. JAKE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN
A mournful blues number plays as we begin a sad tour of the
revaged house in the kitchen where we see that every edible
item has been consumed. The cupboards are bare. The
refrigerator is open and empty. There are cartons, cans
and rubbish everywhere.
INT. DINING ROOM
The dining room table is completely covered by a pyramid of
beer cans. The pyramid collapses.

INT. LIVING ROOM
We move around the room to see that a painting that featured
a face without eyes or a mouth has had eyes and mouth drawn
in with a marking pen. An ancient mask in a plexi display
case, lit by a pin spot has cigarettes up its nose and a
slice of pizza on its forehead. A line of cigarettes have
been left to burn out on the piano. A record album is
laying inside a pizza box. We move off the box to find a
pizza going around on the turntable. We move up to see the
tape deck has a cassette jammed into it upside down. A
hundred feet of tape is balled-up in the heads. On the
ceiling is a big blob of dip with a potato chip stuck in it.
As we reach Jake, he's sitting on the couch in the destroyed
living room. He sighs and pops a beer. He takes a sip.
JAKE
What a fuckin' disaster.
He sets the beer down on the coffee table. He sits back on·
the couch. A beat and he bolts forward and gawks the coffee
table.

You have your friends. We'll stay the
hell away. Whatever you want, honey.
You let me know. Have it the way you
want it. The way you want it.
She pulls herself up and kisses his cheek.
SAM
Thanks, Daddy.
JIM
No problem. Everything else okay?
Sam nods. Jim gives her a wink and a kiss on the forehead.
JIM
See you in the morning.
He stands up and starts for the foyer. Sam whimpers to him.
SAM
No.
She starts to cry. Jim turns around.
SAM
It's not okay.
Jim hurries back to the couch. Sam throws her arms around
him.
JIM
What's wrong?
SAM
I don't know. Everything.
JIM
Everything what?
Sam sits back on the couch and quickly wipes away her tears.
SAM
Everything, everything.
JIM
Your birthday?
SAM
No.

85
CONTINUED
She's a little embarrassed to reveal the real reason she's
crying.
SAM
There's this boy.
JIM
Oh, Lord. Is this something I
should go get Mom for?
Sam shakes her head.
SAM
No. I like this boy a real lot.
And he doesn't like me.
JIM
Are you nice to him?
SAM
Daddy, I don't know. It's really
stupid. It's not important.
JIM
If you're crying over it, it's
important.
SAM
I like him so much and I just know I
can't ever have him.
JIM
Why not?
SAM
Because I'm just a dork.
JIM
A what?
SAM
He's a senior and he's beautiful and
he's got this great girl friend and
I'm just blah.
JIM
I don't think you're blah.
SAM
Trust me, I am.
CONTINUED
86

JIM
Can I tell you a little story?
SAM
About the Navy?
JIM
No, it's a love story.
SAM
Are you in it?
Jim nods. As bad as Sam feels, she cracks up at the
thought of her father in love.
JIM
This was awhile ago, I combed my
hair different, I was young and fit
and I didn't walk around the house in
my undershorts. I was in college and
I was head over heels in love with
this girl.
Sam giggles.
JIM
Don't hurt my feelings.
SAM
Sorry.
JIM
Anyway, she wouldn't even look at me.
So I knew that if anything was going
to happen, I'd have to make the first
move.
SAM
I just can't picture you making a
move on a girl.
JIM
Either could I. But after worrying
about it for a couple of weeks, I
finally got up the courage to go to
the sorority house where she lived.
I let her know I wanted to see her
and she came down. I wanted to
faint. She walked over to me and ....
SAM
I think I know how this ends, Dad.
She turned out to be Mom and you
guys got married and had us.
CONTINUED
87
CONTINUED
JIM
(shakes his
head)
No. She stomped on my foot so hard,
she broke two toes. I met your mom
at the hospital.
There's a pause as both Jim and Sam realize that his story
has no relevance to Sam's situation.
JIM
I guess that doesn't help you much,
huh?
SAM
Not really.
JIM
Yeah. Well, if it's any consolation,
I love you and if this guy can't see
in you all the beautiful, wonderful
things I see, he's got the problem.
SAM
It just hurts.
JIM
That's why they call them crushes. If
they were easy, they'd call them some-
thing else.
SAM
If I were Ginny, I'd have this guy
crawling on his knees.
JIM
Let me tell you something about Ginny.
I love her just as much as I love you.
But she's a different person. I'm a
little worried about her. When things
come easy, you don't always appreciate
them. You, I'm not worried. When it
happens to you, Samantha, it'll be
forever.
He leans over and kisses her forehead. He draws her close
and hugs her. She kisses him and holds him as tight as he
holds her.
JIM
I won't be able to sleep unless I
know I helped you out with this
little talk, so would you be a sport
and lie to me?
Sam giggles.
CONTINUED
88

SAM
Yeah, sure, Daddy.
Jim gives her a squeeze and a kiss on the forehead. He
gets up and crosses to the foyer. He stops and turns back
to her.
JIM
One more thing, sweetheart.

Where in the hell are your under-
shorts?
CLOSEUP - SAM'S PANTIES
A boy's hand carefully examines Sam's panties.
INT. JAKE'S LIVING ROOM
The Geek i- sharing his treasure with Jake. Jake regards
the panties with an almost religious reverence.
JAKE
These are really hers?
The Geek nods proudly.
JAKE
Did you pants her or something?
GEEK
She gave them to me.
Jake looks curiously at the Geek.
JAKE
Did you ... ?
Jake hand-signals intercourse.
GEEK
Oh God, no. She's cranked for you.
I told her you asked about her and
she freaked.
JAKE
(puzzled)
Really? She came up to me in the gym
and just looked at me like I was a leper.
The Geek's getting off on playing the expert.

GEEK
Girls'll do that, Jake. You see, they
know guys are like in perpetual heat.
They know this and they enjoy pumping
us up. It's pure power politics.
JAKE
I thought she hated my guts.
GEEK
Games, Jake. Silly, torturous games.
You know how many times a week I go
without lunch because some bitch
borrows my lunch money? Any halfway
decent girl can rob me because I'm
too torqued-up to say no. It's
heinous.
JAKE
You better not be pulling my chain.
It'd be a major downer to try and
get together with her and find out
she really does think I'm a wimp.
GEEK
Look at it this way, what happens to
me if I bullshit you?
JAKE
(matter-of-
factly)
I reach down your throat and squeeze
your heart.
GEEK
Right. So, why would I lie?
Jake sits back on the couch and toys with the panties.
GEEK
(serious)
But I feel compelled to mention that
if all you want off her is a piece of
ass, I'll do my best to either do it
myself or get somebody bigger than me
to reach down yo~r throat and squeeze
your heart. Shes an excellent human

American society would give up their

JAKE
I can get a piece of ass anytime I want.
Shit, I got Caroline in my room right
now, passed out cold. I could violate
her ten different ways if I wanted.
The Geek's eyes pop open.
GEEK
What are you waiting for?
JAKE
I don't know. She's beautiful and
built and all that but I'm just not
interested anymore.
GEEK
(sexy; macho)
Does that really matter, guy?
JAKE
Yeah, it matters. She's totally
insensitive. Look what she did to
my house. She doesn't know shit
about love. All she craves is
party action. I want a serious
girl friend. Somebody I can talk
to. Somebody I can love and who'll
love me back.
He's a little embarrassed by his romantic plea.
JAKE
Does that sound psycho?
GEEK
Oh, hell no. I think a ton of guys
feel the same way, only they don't
have the balls to admit it. Samantha's
a major piece of work. She's nice and
she cares.
JAKE
I'll make a deal with you.

the panties)
Let me have these and I'll let you
take Caroline home.

JAKE
She's all yours. Except you have to
make sure she gets home. You can't

or something.
The Geek scratches his head. He can't take the offer.
GEEK
I'm only a freshman.
JAKE
Hey, she's so blitzed she won't know
the difference.
GEEK
I mean, don't have a car.
JAKE
Take mine.
GEEK
I don't have a license either.
JAKE
I trust you.
The Geek swallows hard.
GEEK
I better not.
JAKE
You're sure?
GEEK
Yeah. I'm sure.
INT. JAKE'S GARAGE
Jake and the Geek carry Caroline out of the house. Jake
has her under the arms. The Geek has her feet. She giggles
as they carry her to Jake's father's Rolls Royce. Jake
balances her on his knee and opens the front passenger
door.

JAKE

Jake drops Caroline on the seat. He takes her feet from
the Geek and shoves her in. He plants her feet in the
footwells and pulls her skirt down. He thinks better of
it and looks at the Geek.
JAKE
(referring to
the skirt)
Up or down?
The Geek flashes a look at Caroline.
GEEK'S POINT OF VIEW
Caroline's best party panties and two perfect thighs.
GEEK
(embarrassed)
Um ... you can leave it up.
He pulls her skirt up.
JAKE
Go for it, stud.
He hands the Geek the car keys. The Geek walks around to
the driver's side and gets in. He crosses himself and
starts the engine. Caroline rolls her head over to the

Music's blasting. The Geeker's in way over his head.
GEEK
Can we turn the music down, please?
I'm a first time driver. I need
to concentrate.
Caroline reaches over and honks the horn.
GEEK
Cut it out!
She turns on the windshield washers. The Geek struggles to
turn them off. She hits the convertable top switch and it
starts to go up.
GEEK
Knock it off! You're going to get
us in serious trouble!
Caroline pops open a can of beer and tries to feed it to
the Geek.
CAROLINE
Chug-a-lug, pooh bear.
He takes it from her throws it out the window. The car
phone rings. Caroline grabs it.
CAROLINE
Hello?
The Geek takes it away from her. She pops another beer.
GEEK

Now we're both on the pill!
The Geek looks at her with horror. He frantically spits
the pill out the window.
GEEK
You gave me a birth control pill?!
Do you have any idea what estrogen

I know exactly what it does to a

EXT. HOUSE - FRONT BEDROOM WINDOW
The Geek creeps through the bushes to the window. He looks
around and knocks on the glass.
INT. CLIFF'S BEDROOM
The bedroom is jammed with computer hardware. A monitor is
glowing with a three-dimensional representation of a pair
of human brains. A printer is clicking away as it receives
an overseas transmission from his Egyptian Dungeons and
Dragons partner. Shelves are burdened with manuals,
software, stacks of print-outs and precision tools. The
walls are decorated with erotic print-outs -- women in
compromising positions done in "e's", "a's" and "x's".
Cliff is sleeping in a single bed. He's wearing a black
vinyl headband fitted with electrodes to scan and record
the activity of his sleeping brain. He is connected to the
computer and to his friend, Bryce, who is similarly out-
fitted and is asleep on the floor next to Cliff's bed in
a sleeping bag. Cliff and Bryce hear the Geek's insistant

put on his orthodonic headgear. A modest bird dropping is
splattered on one of his eyeglass lenses. There's a lip-
stick mark on his forehead. Caroline snuggles against
his chest. She plants a sleepy kiss on his chest and opens
her eyes. Half her hair is missing from the night before.

rears back from him.

head. She reaches into her lap, lifts a buttock and removes
the Geek's hand. She leans back over him and studies his
face. She holds his cheeks and turns his head back and forth.
CAROLINE
This is totally weird.
The Geek moans softly and puts his arm around her. Caroline
opens her purse. It's stuffed full of the hair her friend
cut off the night before, she studies it for a moment and

bare side. If she weren't so baffled she'd scream.

Brenda's holding Ginny up as Sam puts shoes on her. The
painkiller's have kicked in.
GINNY
(giggles)
Jesus Christ! Do I feel funky!
SARA
Mom? Are you still married even if
you don't remember what happened at
your wedding?
The Organist opens the door and looks in.
ORGANIST
Is everything okay?
GINNY
Aces to the max, munchkin.
BRENDA
(embarrassed)
We' 11 be ready in a moment.
ORGANIST
I can't find the groom.
Ginny lets out a titter.
GINNY
Cruise the bars. That's where I
found him.

INT. ROLLS - BACKSEAT
The Geek's still sleeping. Caroline gently slaps his face.
CAROLINE
You wanna wake up, please?
The Geek stirs and opens his eyes. He looks around in
bewilderment until he orients himself. He sits up with a
start.

GEEK
Where am I?
CAROLINE
I'll tell you where you are if you
tell me who you are.
The Geek peels off his headgear.
GEEK
I'm Farmer Ted.
CAROLINE
You're in a parking lot.
He cranes his neck and looks out of the car.
GEEK
What happened?
CAROLINE
Got me, junior.
He notices that half her hair's missing.
GEEK
Did I do that?
CAROLINE
At this point, anything's possible.
The Geek scratches his head -- a faint memory comes to mind.
GEEK
Did we ... ?
CAROLINE
I'm pretty sure.
GEEK
Did I ... enjoy it?
(answers his
own questions)
What am I? Nuts? Of course I did.
I had to.
(pause)
Did you?
Caroline thinks for a troubled moment.
CAROLINE
You know, I have this weird feeling
I did.
111
INT. CHURCH - ANTEROOM
Brenda's walking Ginny up and down, trying to get her to
drink coffee.
BRENDA
This is ridiculous! Ginny!
Ginny looks at Brenda with woeful, sleepy eyes. Sam and
Sara watch from a window bench.
SAM
The family has definitely gone into
a new orbit.
SARA
Yeah. It's kind of scary. I have
to live with them another ten years.
SAM
Does my dress look wretched?
Sara studies it, concentrating on the bust.
SARA
You could use some carrots.
SAM
If I stuff Kleenex down my front,
will you tell everybody in the world?
SARA
Just boys.
Sam curls her lip. She pushes in on one of her boobs. The
cup caves in.
SAM
Excellent, huh? Nothing ever goes
right for me. I'm cursed.
EXT. SAM'S HOUSE
Jake's Porsche is parked out in front. He's at the front
door.
EXT. HOUSE - FRONT PORCH
Jake rings the bell. Inside we hear horrible moaning and
groaning and animal-like bellowing. Jake peeks in the side
door windows.
112
INT. FOYER
Dong limps in wearing Brenda's pink bathrobe and boxer
shorts. He's holding two cold cans of Coke to his
temples. He's walking bow-legged. He has a black eye.
DONG
Mwaaa. Let me die. Mwaaaa.
He moves the cans to the groin injury he sustained when
Dorothy kicked him.
EXT. PORCH
Dong opens the door. Jake is startled to see him. Dong is
even more startled. He screams and slams the door closed.
DONG (O.C.)
Eek! I call police! F.B.I. !
Go away!
JAKE
Open the door!
DONG (O.C .. )
No way Jose! You beat up my face!
Jake leans down and yells into the mail chute.
JAKE
You jumped me and squeezed my nuts!
Jake steps back as Dong opens the door.
DONG
(surprised)
That you?!
(apologetic)
So sorry. I thought it new American
girl friend.
JAKE
(impatient)
Forget it, okay? Just get Samantha.
DONG
She not here.
JAKE
Don't jerk me around. Where is she?
CONTINUED
113

DONG
She get married.
JAKE
What?!
DONG
She at church. She get married to
oily Bohunk.
Jake turns from the door, puzzled and bewildered.
JAKE
Married?
INT. CHURCH - LOBBY
Guests are filing in. Mike is an usher. A conservatively
dressed couple walks in.
MIKE
Guests of the bride or the groom?
MAN
Bride.
Mike points down the aisle.
MIKE
To your left, sir.
A wildly dressed couple walks in. Mike looks them up and
down and deduces from their clothing that they're guests of
the groom.
MIKE
Friends of the groom, right?
INT. CHURCH - ANTEROOM
Brenda's straightening Ginny's dress. She has her propped
against the wall. Sam and Sara are waiting patiently with
their bouquets.
BRENDA
You're sure you're all right, sweetie?
Ginny nods, yes.
GINNY
It's gonna be a piece of cake, Bren'.

114

SAM
(sincere and warm)
Ginny? I want to tell you something
just in case you pass out. I'm
really happy for you. I'm sorry if
I've been kind of a jerk lately.
GINNY
(slurry and high)
Hey, screw it, honey. I love you
like a sister.
SAM
I know you'll have a great marriage.
She leans over and kisses Ginny. Ginny smiles and keels
over backwards.
INT. CHURCH - LOBBY
Jim waits nervously for the music cue and the bride. In
the adjacent room, we hear a loud thud! The organ comes up
with the first bars of "The Wedding March." Jim rushes to
the door of the anteroom and opens it. Inside we see
Brenda helping a dazed Ginny to her feet.
INT. CHURCH
The Organist stops playing and listens, along with everyone
else, to Jim and Brenda.
JIM
I don't care what she has! Look at
her!
BRENDA
Would you please be quiet?! We
don't have to announce to everybody
that she has her period!
INT. CHURCH - REVEREND AND RUDY
They exchange embarrassed smiles. Behind them, the
organist pokes her head out of the organ chamber window.
GROOM
I guess the guys who thought we had
to get married feel pretty stupid
right about now, huh, padre?
The Reverend nods politely.
115
INT. CHURCH - LOBBY
Brenda helps Ginny onto Jim's arm. He supports her.
Brenda hurries down the aisle, apologizing as she runs.
She takes her seat. Sam and Sara pick up Ginny's train.
Jim starts down the aisle with Ginny.
INT. CHURCH
Ginny flashes stoned smiles as she shuffles down the aisle.
GINNY
(whispers)
How's it goin'? I hope none of
you guys got me woks.
Jim squeezes her arm. She shuts up. They pass a woman with
a feathered hat and Ginny can't resist batting the feather.
EXT. PARKING LOT - ROLLS
Caroline and the Geek are chatting amicably. There's a
hint of tenderness in the conversation.
CAROLINE
You were awfully nice to me. I must
have been mucho obnoxioso.
GEEK
You bit me.
CAROLINE
I'm sorry.
GEEK
It's okay. I guess last night was
just about the best night of my life.
Now and probably the future, too.
CAROLINE
Yeah. What I remember was okay. I
never went out with a freshman. Not
even when I was a freshman.
GEEK
Me either.
CAROLINE
You were pretty crazy.
CONTINUED
116
CONTINUED
GEEK
I was?
CAROLINE
Yeah, but you know what I like best?
GEEK
My clean, close shave?
CAROLINE
Waking up in your arms.
The Geek is flabbergasted. He looks at his arms.
GEEK
These things?
EXT. CHURCH
Jake's car pulls up in front of the church. A rented
limousine is waiting. The Driver is leaning on the fender
smoking a cigarette.
JAKE
(to the Driver)
Is there a wedding going on in there?
DRIVER
That's the rumor.
JAKE
You wouldn't know if the bride is
like a sophomore in high school
would you?
The Driver looks at him like he's crazy.
DRIVER
This ain't Kentucky.
JAKE
(sighs with
relief)
True. I'm sort of like possibly
falling in love with this girl
perhaps and it'd be the shits if
she got married before I got a
chance to take her out, you know?
So ... thanks.
He revs his engine and whips around into the parking lot.
117
EXT. PARKING LOT
Jake pulls up alongside the Rolls. He stands up and looks
out his sunroof into the Rolls.
JAKE
Holy shit!
EXT. ROLLS
Caroline and the Geek are locked in a passionate kiss.
Through half-closed eyes, Caroline sees Jake.
CAROLINE
(voice distorted
by the kiss)
Uh oh.
She pulls away from the Geek, leaving him Frenching the
air. She smiles at Jake.
CAROLINE
(timid)
Hi, Jake.
The Geek hears Jake's name. His eyes open in fear.
Caroline straightens her blouse and pushes her hair back.
CAROLINE
(nervous,
to Jake)
Do you have a minute?
She stands up and swings her legs over the side of the Rolls.
CAROLINE
(to the Geek)
Don't go away.
The car phone rings. Geek answers it. He's annoyed.
GEEK
You wanna learn what happened? Buy
the book.
He hangs up.
INT. JAKE'S CAR
Caroline gets in the passenger side. She's nervous and
unsure of how's she's going to explain herself. He's just
as nervous. They both sit for a moment, exchanging timid,
embarrassed glances.
CONTINUED
118
CONTINUED
JAKE
Sorry about getting you involved
with that guy.
CAROLINE
It's okay. Really.
(nervous
chuckle)
It wasn't too terrible.
(embarrassed)
Weird?
She's embarrassed to admit to her feelings for the Geek.
Jake smiles. Regardless of how little he's been feeling
for Caroline, it still hurts him that she was with somebody
else. It's a knee-jerk reaction.
JAKE
(recovers
his pride)
So, what should we do?
CAROLINE
About us?
Jake nods uneasily.
CAROLINE
It's gonna be two years for us like
next Thursday.
JAKE
(corrects her)
Wednesday.
CAROLINE
Is it?
Jake nods. There's an uncomfortable pause. For the first
time, Caroline looks innocent and vulnerable.
CAROLINE
Neither one of us is going to die if
it doesn't happen for us.
JAKE
True.
CAROLINE
I just don't know right now. But
I'm covered, okay? I won't get hurt.
CONTINUED
119

Jake is seriously straddling the fence between Sam and
Caroline. He hadn't anticipated this conversation or
Caroline's changed attitude. He doesn't know what to say.
CAROLINE
I'll leave it up to you.
Jake looks over at Caroline. It's his decision. The
situation is of his making and he accepts that it's also
his to resolve. He nods his agreement.
INT. CHURCH
Sunlight streams in the windows, the stained glass glows.
It's peaceful and serene as the ceremony is underway.
INT. CHURCH - SAM
Tears well up in her eyes as she watches her big sister
take the vows. She looks like an angel and even the yellow
dress she hated so much looks lovely on her. There's a
storm of emotion going on inside her. She's happy,
jealous, sad, lonely, angry, hurt. She sniffles and tries
not to cry. Something distracts her. She looks down at
her chest.
CLOSEUP - SAM'S CHEST
The caved-in cup slowly pops out.
INT. CHURCH - GRANDPARENTS
The grandmothers are crying. Howard sniffles. Fred blows
his nose with a loud honk!
INT. CHURCH - MIKE AND SARA
Mike's eyes are wandering across the ceiling. Sara's
picking her seat.
INT. CHURCH - BRENDA AND JIM
They watch with pride. Brenda's crying. Jim lifts his
glasses and dries his eyes.
120
INT. CHURCH - ALTAR
Rudy and Ginny exchange their vows. The Reverend speaks in
hushed and pensive tones.
REVEREND
Do you, Virginia, take this ....
Ginny interrupts him in a casual, slurry voice.
GINNY
You bet, bub.
INT. CHURCH - JIM AND BRENDA
They exchange troubled glances. Brenda looks past Jim to
Rudy's parents and apologizes with a weak smile.
INT. CHURCH - BRUNO AND IRENE
Their mouths are open in alarm.
INT. CHURCH - ALTAR
Ginny peels off her veil and tosses it onto a floral
arrangement.
GINNY
Sorry, I can't see with that
ridiculous thing in my face. Go
ahead. I'm cool now.
The Reverend clears his throat, overlooks Ginny's stoned
interruption and continues.
REVEREND
... take this man to be your lawful
wedded husband?
GINNY
(looking
at Rudy)
Oh, for sure. He's hot.
INT. CHURCH - SAM
She winces at the mess Ginny's making of her wedding.
INT. CHURCH - MIKE AND SARA
Sara rolls her eyes. Mike shakes his head and covers his
face with his hands.
121
INT. CHURCH - REVEREND
He repeats the vow for Rudy.
REVEREND
Do you, Rudolf take this woman to
be your lawful wedded wife?
GINNY
(to Rudy)
Your turn, babe.
RUDY
(ignores her)
I do.
REVEREND
With these rings ....
Rudy's best man hands him Ginny's ring. Sam hands Ginny
Rudy's ring.
GINNY
Thanks, Sam.
(looks at her
dress, whispers)
You know that dress doesn't look
nearly as shitty on you as it did
at the store.
Sam turns Ginny around to face Rudy. Ginny drops the ring.
GINNY
Oh, crap!
She gets down on all fours and picks it up.
INT. CHURCH GRANDPARENTS
All four lean forward at the same time, hardly believing
what they're seeing.
INT. CHURCH - ALTAR
The Reverend races through the rest of the ceremony to get
it over with before anything else happens.
REVEREND
... I thee wed.
Ginny and Rudy exchange rings.

REVEREND
You may now kiss the bride.
Rudy puts his arms on Ginny's waist. He leans forward and
puckers. Ginny keels over backwards, leaving Rudy kissing
air. Organ music surges in.
EXT. CHURCH
Both families stream out of the church and gather around
the door. The photographer sets himself up at the bottom
of the stairs. Ginny and Rudy come out and everybody
tosses rice. Ginny tries to catch some in her mouth. Rudy
quickly hustles her to the waiting limousine. The crowd
begins to head toward the parking lot.
EXT. CHURCH - SAM
She remembers that Ginny's left her veil inside.
SAM
She forgot her veil!
She turns and goes back into the church.
INT. CHURCH - SAM
She heads back up the aisle for the altar. She wipes her
tears away as she walks. She reaches the altar and retrieves
the veil from the floral arrangement. She straightens it out
and very carefully and reverently folds it.
EXT. CHURCH - GRANDPARENTS
The four of them head across the lawn.
HELEN
Didn't Ginny look lovely?
DOROTHY
And so relaxed.
FRED
Let's hope she stays awake long
enough to consummate this thing.
HELEN
Fred!

HOWARD
Who're we riding with?
Jim and Brenda approach with Mike and Sara trailing
behind. Jim and Brenda are bickering.
JIM
(to Brenda)
Let's just get the hell over to the
reception!
BRENDA
Hold your horses!
JIM
I don't want her sitting in the
cake ....
BRENDA
She's not going to sit in the cake!
Reverend Allen didn't drive so I'll
take him and the organist and the
kids. You take the old people.
FRED
Now she's calling us old!
Brenda hurries away. Jim ushers the old folks to the street.
JIM
Let's put a fire under it!
The photographer comes up and tries to pose Jim and the
old people.
JIM
Will you knock it off!
He groans and joins the old folks in a group pose. They
all smile. Flash!
JIM
Okay, let's move it out!
Jim and the old folks cross the street between the traffic
jam of horn honking cars.
EXT. CHURCH
Sam comes out of the church to find that her thoughfulness
in retrieving Ginny's veil has been rewarded by her being
left behind. The crowning blow. She stands alone on the
church steps in her stupid dress with her stupid flowers,
tears on her face. She looks down at the ground. The
loneliest girl in all of creation. She looks up and wipes
her tears on her arm. She drops her head again.
124
CLOSEUP - SAM
Her head is bowed. She looks up slowly through her hair.
She pauses with her head raised halfway. She can't believe
her eyes.
HER POINT OF VIEW - THE CARS
have all pulled away and parked on the street directly across
from the church is Jake's Porsche. Jake is standing next to
the car, looking across at Sam. He's smiling nervously. He
raises his hand, offers a tiny, tentative wave.
JAKE
Hi.
CLOSEUP - SAM
For a moment, she doesn't think he's talking to her. She
glances over her shoulder to make sure he's looking at her
and not someone behind her.
EXT. STREET - JAKE
His smile fades. He interprets her hesitation in returning
his greeting as rejection. He feels like a fool.
JAKE
Shit. She hates me. I knew it.
He carefully reaches around behind and opens the door. Then
he quickly jumps in and starts the engine. He pulls away.
CLOSEUP - SAM
Her eyes open wide in horror. She screams.
SAM
Jake!
She takes off down the steps.
EXT. STREET
Jake slams on the brakes. He sees Sam running. He throws
the car in reverse and backs up to the church. He jumps
out. Sam waits for a car to pass, then runs to him.
125
CLOSEUP - SAM AND JAKE
She doesn't know what to say. He doesn't know what to
say. It's the moment they've both been waiting for and
neither one knows what to do.
SAM
Hi.
JAKE
Hi.
SAM
What're you doing here?
JAKE
I heard that you were here.
SAM
You came for me?
JAKE
Is that okay?
SAM
Actually, it's excellent.
JAKE
Do you have to go to a reception or
something?
SAM
I'm supposed to.
JAKE
Can I call you later?
SAM
Yeah.
EXT. STREET
Jake gets back in the car. He puts it in gear and starts
to pull away.
SAM
I mean, no!
Jake stops.
JAKE
No, I can't call?
SAM
I mean no, I'm not going to the
reception.
Jake grins from ear to ear.
126
EXT. PARKING LOT
Jim is helping the old people into the car. Something
catches his eye. He watches curiously.
HIS POINT OF VIEW - JAKE
opens his car door for Sam. Sam sees Jim. She points to
Jake as he walks around to the driver's side to let Jim
know that Jake is the love of her life.
JIM
a smile spreads across his face as he realizes that Jake is
the boy Sam was talking about the night before. He winks
anel gives Sam the thumbs up.
DOROTHY (O.C.)
Will you hurry up, Jim! We're ....
Without taking his eyes off Sam, Jim slams the car door,
cutting off Dorothy.
DOROTHY
through the backseat window, we see that Jim has closed the
door on her hat.
SAM
She throws Jim a big kiss and gets in the car.
EXT. COUNTRY CLUB - PORTICO - EVENING
Brenda, Jim, Mike and Sara are under the portico. Brenda's
worried, Jim is smug and coy. He knows where Sam is. He
plays along with the others.
BRENDA
What could have happened to Sam?
JIM
I'm sure she's fine.
MIKE
Maybe she blew this thing off. It's
possible she's not as dumb as she
looks.

127

JIM
She'll be all right.
BRENDA
I know she's still upset about
her birthday.
MIKE
We dumped on her royally, Mom.
SARA
I feel terrible and it's not even me

JIM
We'll make it up to her.
BRENDA
Poor thing.
MIKE
(wipes his
nose on
his sleeve)
Yeah. Pathetic underdog wench.
BRENDA
Jim, will you call home? I can't
stand the thought of her sitting by
herself alone in a dark house.
The family heads back into the club. Jim hangs back smiling
knowingly.
INT. JAKE'S HOUSE - INDOOR POOL
The room is dark except for a fragile glow of yellow in the
center of the pool.
CLOSEUP - BIRTHDAY CAKE
A birthday cake with sixteen lit candles rests on a
styrofoam ring floating in the pool. Sam and Jake are in
the water on either side of the ring, looking across the
candles at each other. They slowly circle the cake,
looking long and deep into each other's eyes.
SAM
Thanks for getting my undies back.

It already came true.
Sam looks down at the cake, takes a deep breath and blows
out the candles.
